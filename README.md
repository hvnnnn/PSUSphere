# PSUSphere

*PSUSphere* is a Django-based web application designed to manage university student organizations, colleges, academic programs, and student memberships. It provides a robust backend structure and a customized administrative interface for efficient data handling.

## Description

This project serves as a centralized platform for tracking student involvement in various campus organizations. It utilizes Django's powerful ORM to maintain relationships between:
* *Colleges* (e.g., College of Computing Studies)
* *Programs* (e.g., BS Computer Science)
* *Organizations* (e.g., Association of Computing Students)
* *Students* and their *Memberships*

The system allows administrators to easily create, read, update, and delete records, as well as generate dummy data for testing purposes.

## Key Features

* *Organization Management:* Track student organizations and their affiliated colleges.
* *Student Database:* Manage student profiles, including ID numbers and degree programs.
* *Membership Tracking:* Record which students belong to which organizations and when they joined.
* *Custom Admin Interface:*
    * *Search:* Quickly find students, organizations, or programs by name or description.
    * *Filters:* Filter lists by College or Join Date.
    * *Optimized Views:* Custom list displays for better readability.
* *Data Automation:* Includes a custom management command (create_initial_data) to populate the database with realistic fake data using the Faker library.

* *Python* (Backend Logic)
* *Django* (Web Framework)
* *SQLite* (Database)
